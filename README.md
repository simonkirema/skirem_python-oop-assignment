# Python OOP Assignments 🏗️🐍

This repo contains Python assignments that demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.

---

## 📌 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes and methods.
- Demonstrated **encapsulation** using a protected attribute (`_storage`).
- Added an inheritance layer with a `SmartCameraPhone` class.
- Example actions: making calls, checking storage, taking photos.

## 📌 Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Created a `Vehicle` base class with a `move()` method.
- Implemented different subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) that override `move()`.
- Demonstrated **polymorphism** by iterating through objects with the same method but different behavior.
